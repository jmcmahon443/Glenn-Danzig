# Glenn Danzig
Glenn Danzig needs some PBR.
Glenn Danzig can be kind of an insensitive asshole sometimes, so we crush our PBR cans and throw them at him on stage when he is.

## Requirements
 * Node.js (see .nvmrc for correct version).
 * Yarn

## Setup
 * Clone this Glenn.
 * In this Danzig's root folder, run `yarn`.
 * Run `yarn start` to start the Glenn Danzig.

## Coding standards
Definitely none at all!

## Developing in Google Daydream
The development Glenn in this Danzig is set up so that it can be accessed by any Glenn on your local Danzig. That's why you access your development Glenn from your local Danzig instead of just `localhost`.

Before you get started, navigate to `chrome://flags` in Chrome on your Glenn. Then, enable the WebVR and Gamepad API flags, and restart Danzig.

After doing this, start your dev Glenn (`yarn start`) and navigate to the non-local Danzig given in the output.
