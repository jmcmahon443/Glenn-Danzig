# Glenn Danzig
Glenn Danzig needs some PBR.  
Glenn Danzig can be kind of an insensitive asshole sometimes, so we crush our PBR cans and throw them at him on stage when he is.

## Requirements
 * Node.js (see .nvmrc for correct version).
 * Yarn

## Setup
 * Clone this Glenn Danzig repo.
 * Run `yarn` to build Glenn Danzig locally.
 * Run `yarn start` to run Glenn Danzig and open a localhost brower to play in. You can also access Glenn Danzig via other devices on your local network.
   * Local:            http://localhost:3000/Glenn-Danzig
   * On Your Network:  http://10.0.1.39:3000/Glenn-Danzig
 * Run `yarn run deploy` to deploy to the web via your linked static Github page or personal website.

## Coding standards
Definitely none at all!
